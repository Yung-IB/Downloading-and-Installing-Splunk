# Splunk for Security Monitoring: Detecting Log Tampering

This report details the installation and configuration of Splunk Enterprise for a foundational security monitoring use case: detecting the clearing of Windows Event Logs. The project's objective is to demonstrate how a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool like Splunk can provide visibility into actions that may indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

The core of this analysis involves simulating an attacker's action of clearing the Windows Security Log and using Splunk to detect the specific event generated by this tampering (EventCode 1102).

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Execution

The project was executed in four phases on a Windows system.

**Phase 1: Splunk Installation**
Splunk Enterprise version 9.4.1 was downloaded from the official website and installed on a local Windows machine. The process involved running the installer, accepting the license agreement, and configuring a local administrator account.

**Phase 2: Data Ingestion**
After installation, the local Windows Event Logs were added as a data source within Splunk, allowing Splunk to begin collecting and indexing security, application, and system logs.

**Phase 3: Simulating a Malicious Act**
To simulate an attacker covering their tracks, the Windows Security Event Log was manually cleared using the Event Viewer application.

**Phase 4: Detection and Visualization**
The Splunk Search & Reporting app was used to query the indexed data for the log clearing event.
* **SPL Query:** The following Search Processing Language (SPL) query was used to isolate the event:
    ```spl
    source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=1102
    ```
* **Dashboard Creation:** A basic dashboard was created in Splunk to visualize the results of this query, demonstrating real-time monitoring capabilities for this specific Indicator of Activity.

### üìä Findings and Analysis

The primary finding is that Splunk successfully detected the log clearing action. When the Windows Security Log was cleared, a new event with **EventCode 1102** ("The audit log was cleared") was generated by the operating system. Splunk, having already been configured to ingest these logs, immediately indexed this new event.

This demonstrates a critical capability of a properly configured SIEM: even if an attacker erases the historical log data, the act of erasure itself is a detectable and alertable event. This action serves as a high-fidelity Indicator of Activity (IOA) that points directly to evidence tampering.

### üìú Recommendations

* **Implement Log Forwarding:** In a real-world scenario, logs should be sent from endpoint systems to a central Splunk instance in real-time using Splunk Forwarders. This minimizes the window of opportunity for an attacker to clear logs on a local machine before they are collected
* **Create Critical Alerts:** Configure real-time alerts in Splunk for high-severity events like EventCode 1102. Any instance of a security log being cleared should trigger an immediate notification to the security team.
* **Secure the SIEM:** Restrict access to the Splunk instance using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and strong authentication to prevent unauthorized users from tampering with the monitoring system itself.
